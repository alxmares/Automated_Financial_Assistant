## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves extracting, processing, and analyzing data from images of receipts using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Python. The key steps are:

- **Text Extraction**: Using EasyOCR to read text from images.
- **Data Cleaning**: Using Regular Expressions to identify and clean relevant data such as dates and numerical values.
- **Data Transformation**: Formatting extracted data into structured tables with Pandas.
- **Data Visualization**: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting data distributions and trends.
- **Excel Integration**: Automating the process of adding structured data to Excel files using Openpyxl.

## üìà Key Findings

1. **Efficient Text Extraction**: EasyOCR was effective in reading and extracting relevant text from receipts, demonstrating its capability in processing various fonts and layouts.
2. **Data Structuring**: The use of Pandas allowed for efficient structuring and manipulation of data into a tabular format suitable for analysis and storage.
3. **Automation**: Integrating Openpyxl for Excel automation streamlined the process of updating records, making the workflow more efficient and less prone to errors.

## üìä Power BI Report

To enhance the analysis and visualization capabilities, Power BI was employed to create detailed and interactive reports. The key features of the Power BI reports include:

- **Data Integration**: Connecting processed data from Python scripts directly to Power BI for real-time updates.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Utilizing Power BI‚Äôs rich set of visualizations to provide insights into spending patterns.
- **DAX Functions**: Implementing DAX to create complex measures and calculated columns for more in-depth analysis.
